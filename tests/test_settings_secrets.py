"""Credential-shaped settings do not render their own plaintext.

**This pins a property, not a fix for an observed leak.** Nothing in `src/` reads
these fields today and `Settings` has no export path - no endpoint serves it, no
audit payload embeds it. The gap is that nothing *stops* a value reaching a log
line, an exception message or a hashed payload if one ever does: a plain `str`
field renders itself in `repr()`, in `str()`, in an f-string and in both dump
forms, and every one of those is a place a credential can arrive without anyone
choosing to put it there.

The five fields are not listed here. They are matched by name, so a
`redis_url` or `stripe_api_key` added later arrives protected rather than
arriving plain and waiting for someone to notice - the failure mode
`services/confidence` already shipped, where `ul_listing` fell out of a
hand-written list and auto-accepted at 0.99.

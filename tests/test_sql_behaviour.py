"""What the DDL actually *does*, measured against a running PostgreSQL.

`test_sql_schema.py` next door asserts the DDL's text. That catches a fix being
reverted, and it cannot catch a fix that was never right: every security defect
this schema shipped was one where the SQL read correctly and the server behaved
otherwise. `USING (true)` on a write policy looks like "the write path is
unrestricted", not like "the application role can declassify every confidential
row in one statement" - but that is what it did, and only a live server said so.

So each test here descends from a defect that was *measured* against a cluster:
the attack is run, and the assertion is that it now fails. The docstring on each
one names what it used to do.

**Skipped unless `PROCUREMENT_TEST_DSN` points at a disposable database.** CI
supplies one from a `pgvector/pgvector` service container. Locally, over TCP
with password authentication, which is what CI does:

    echo postgres > /tmp/pg/pw
    initdb -D /tmp/pg/data -U postgres --auth-host=scram-sha-256 --pwfile=/tmp/pg/pw
    pg_ctl -D /tmp/pg/data -o '-p 5433 -h 127.0.0.1' start
    PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5433 -U postgres -c 'create database procurement'
    PROCUREMENT_TEST_DSN='postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/procurement' \
        uv run pytest tests/test_sql_behaviour.py

**Use TCP and a password, not a Unix socket with `trust`.** The first version of
this docstring recommended the socket, and the socket never exercises
authentication: the suite passed locally and failed 8 of 23 in CI, because the
DDL creates its roles without passwords and the container's `pg_hba.conf`
requires `scram-sha-256`. A local setup that cannot reproduce a CI failure is
worse than no local setup, because it is trusted. See `TEST_ROLE_PASSWORD`.

The database is **dropped and recreated per session**. Never point this at
anything you care about; the fixture says so again at the point of use.

One trap is load-bearing enough to state here rather than in a comment. A
`FOR EACH ROW` trigger never fires on an empty table, so an append-only check
against zero rows passes vacuously - it was the first thing that fooled the
original hand-run checklist. `seeded` below therefore inserts real rows, and
every mutation test depends on it.

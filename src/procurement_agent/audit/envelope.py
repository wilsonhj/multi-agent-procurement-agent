"""H.3 - the audit envelope, the preimage, and the digest, per D-13 section 2.

    hash = SHA-256(JCS({
        "v": 1, "stream", "seq", "event_type", "actor",
        "recorded_at", "prev_hash": lowercase-hex or null,
        "payload": {...}
    }))

**One JCS object, never a concatenation.** The sketch this replaced was
`sha256(prev_hash || canonical_payload || ...)`, and it was wrong twice. The
trailing `...` left the field set unenumerated, so two implementations could
disagree about what is covered while both believing they followed it; and a
delimiter-free concatenation is ambiguous by construction, because distinct
field values can produce identical bytes. Wrapping the envelope in one canonical
object fixes both at once - JCS gives unambiguous framing for free, and the
object's keys *are* the enumeration.

**`payload` embeds as the parsed JSON object, not as the `payload_canonical`
string.** D-13 flags this as the one reading that looks obvious both ways and
hashes differently: one nests an object, the other nests a quoted string. The
consequence of getting it backwards is the worst outcome available here -
chains that verify under this implementation and fail under every correct one.

**So the digest is not injective over stored bytes, and something outside it has
to be.** Embedding the parse means the exact bytes of `payload_canonical` are
not covered: `{"a":1}`, `{"a":1.0}`, `{"a":1E0}`, `{"a": 1 }` and `{"a":1,"a":2}`
are five distinct stored strings with one digest. This is not academic, because
`payload jsonb` is `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (payload_canonical::jsonb)` and jsonb
preserves the numeric literal text it is given - so rewriting `"value":400` to
`"value":400.0` changes what every human and every SQL query reads while the
digest still matches.

What closes it is `verify._check_payload`'s `payload_not_canonical` check, which
recomputes the JCS form and compares the bytes. **D-13 does not require that
check, and the integrity claim does not hold without it** - an implementation
written against the decision alone accepts all five. It is named here, in the
module that creates the gap, so the two are not read separately.

Changing the preimage to embed the canonical *string* would close it at the
source and is deliberately not done: `v` exists precisely because altering the
hashed field set re-bases every chain ever written, and that is the irreversible
window D-13 names.

**Two canonicalisation schemes live in this codebase, and this is the boundary
between them** (D-13 asks for the restatement to sit in WP-H rather than in the
decision record). C4, here, uses JCS because an audit chain has to be verifiable
by an implementation that is not this one, and cross-language agreement is worth
more than Python fidelity. C6, the workbook projection in D-14, uses sorted-key
JSON with `repr` floats because ECMAScript number rules collapse `650.0` to
`650`, erasing an int/float distinction the store's `value: object` genuinely
carries. The same collapse applies to anything hashed here - which is accepted,
not overlooked. Values that must survive it are the reason
`schema.encoding.encode_value` tags `Decimal` as a string, and payloads should
be built from its output.

#: D-13 section 3. Inside the preimage, and load-bearing: without it, changing
#: the hashed field set later invalidates every chain ever written, because a

#: Every version a verifier can still recompute.
#:
#: ⚠️ **D-13 does not say how a verifier learns a row's version.** `v` lives
#: inside the digest and nowhere else - `audit.event` has no version column - so
#: the dispatch section 3 describes cannot read the version, only *test* it.
#: That is sound rather than merely expedient: because `v` is inside the hash, a
#: digest that matches under version k is proof the writer used version k. It is
#: recorded here because the alternative reading - "add a version column later"
#: - would put a forgeable discriminator outside the digest, and because a

#:
#: `web_search` is here because the CHECK has it, and for no better reason.
#: A-49: `audit.event.document_id` is `NOT NULL REFERENCES public.document`, and
#: a gap-triggered web search happens precisely because no document supplied the
#: value, so the row it would describe cannot exist. D-13 routes those events to
#: a separately chained `audit.run_event` table instead. Removing the value is a

"""Workers propose, they do not commit — contract C8, issue #8.

`assert_no_autonomous_overwrite` is a *value* property: a pure predicate over two
fields. It takes no store handle, performs no write, and **cannot enforce that it
is called**. With one serial writer that suffices. Under fan-out it is an honour
system every branch must remember, and it fails three further ways the guard
cannot see: it permits record-over-record (a lost update under concurrency), it
has no notion of ordering (two workers finishing in different orders give
different last-writer-wins outcomes, so the *store* becomes order-dependent and
FR-OUT-06 fails below composition), and nothing stops a branch skipping it.

C8's answer is structural: **there is no overwrite to guard.** Each extraction
appends an immutable `FieldClaim`, and the canonical values are a *projection*
over claims rather than an in-place update.

**Contract C2: a claim carries its `condition`.** The first version of this
module omitted it, and the cost was measured on D-1's own worked example — the
Sungrow SG350HX's `352 kVA @30 degC / 320 @40 degC / 295 @50 degC`. Every
candidate came out `is_unstated()`, so `comparison_pairs` returned **3 pairs**
where D-1 says zero, and `canonical_claims` raised on the trio because the key
could not tell three conditions apart from three contradictions. A claim record
without `condition` defeats the condition gate on the only path that reaches it.

    `repr` answers neither. A dict reprs in *insertion* order, so two extractions
    that read one cooling table's rows in different orders give values that are
    `==` and reprs that are not. The contract has three dict-valued parameters -
    `rating_mva_by_cooling`, `harmonic_spectrum`, `ercot_compliance_items` - and
    under `repr` such a pair counted as a disagreement: an OPEN conflict between
    two identical values, or a `ProposalError` losing the whole field when the
    two shared a claim key. Canonicalising container order fixes that, and is
    the whole of the default mode.

    **`fold_equal=True` additionally folds one number's spellings together.**
    That is the mode `_asserted` wants, because "what does this claim say" is a
    question about the number and not about how it was typed. One extractor
    emits `650` from a table cell, another `650.0` after unit normalisation, and
    under `repr` those were two answers - the same OPEN-conflict-or-lost-field
    pair of costs as the paragraph above, on a plain scalar rather than a dict.
    `ConditionDimensions._reject_non_finite` already folds `-0.0` to `0.0` one
    class over for this reason; nothing folded numeric type here.

    **The modes are separate because `_asserted` must fold and `_identity` must
    not.** `_identity` is the dedup key *and* the total sort order. Fold there
    and two claims differing only in spelling collapse to one row, leaving which
    spelling survives to arrival order - and it is not cosmetic which does:
    `encode_value` writes `650` and `650.0` as different JSON,
    `ComponentInstance._stored_values` hashes that text into `ordering_key`, and
    the workbook's byte output would become a function of which worker finished
    first. That is the FR-OUT-06 failure this module's own docstring opens with.
    So the fold answers "is this the same value" and never "is this the same
    record", and both claims survive to be tied apart by the unfolded order.

    **Where the fold stops short of `==`,** in both cases because the difference
    `==` discards is read by something downstream:

    * `bool`. `True == 1`, and `severity._numeric_value` excludes `bool` for
      exactly this reason - a stray boolean must not read as a nameplate of 1.
      `encode_value` tests `bool` before `int` one layer down for the same
      reason. `repr` already separates them and no branch below rejoins them.
    * `Decimal`. `Decimal("22.00") == Decimal("22")` and the two hash alike, but
      `encoding.py` encodes a Decimal by `str()` and never `normalize()` because
      `conflict_hitl._decimals` reads D-2's rounding floor off that exact text -
      0 places gives 0.5, 1 place gives 0.05. Folding them would pick one
      precision silently and move the floor, which is a behaviour change rather
      than a formatting one. So a `Decimal` reaches `repr` in both modes.

    A `list` against a `tuple` needs no rule at all: `[1] != (1,)`, so the type
    tag telling them apart *is* `==`'s verdict rather than a departure from it.
    A `set` against a `frozenset` is the opposite case - those are `==` - so the
    folding mode gives the two one tag.

    Containers are walked rather than repr'd whole, so both the canonicalisation
    and the fold reach a nested dict - which is where the contract's numbers
    actually sit. The cycle guard is not tidiness: `repr` already handles a
    self-referential value, and a hand-rolled walk that did not would trade a
    false conflict for a `RecursionError`.

    Calls `assert_no_autonomous_overwrite` once at a chokepoint rather than N

    catch - that is the point - but it stays because the projection can still be
    asked to replace a stored system-of-record value with a web-only one when the
    record claim is dropped from a later run.

    **The claim set has to be complete, and both halves of that are checked.**
    `commit` replaces the whole field, so a projection is a statement about every
    condition group and not only the ones it mentions:

    - A claim naming another field would be stored under this one, so the store
      would hold a percentage labelled as watts.
    - A stored group the projection does not cover is *deleted* by the commit,
      and the guard could not see it: keyed on the condition group, it only ever
      compared groups present in both. A web claim under a new condition
      therefore removed a system-of-record value under the old one - the
      autonomous overwrite FR-WEB-03 and FR-HITL-02 forbid, reached by changing
      the condition instead of the value.

    Raised rather than merged. Claims are append-only and `project` is a pure
    function of them, so a group can only vanish because the caller passed a
    subset; folding the leftovers back in would hide that and make the store a
    function of commit history rather than of the claims.

    **`field_name` has to be a contract key**, and that is checked first - before
    the foreign-field check, before the projection, and before the empty-claim-set
    early return. Order is load-bearing: an invented key arriving with no claims
    is exactly what a broken extractor produces, and a check placed after the
    early return would wave it through. Contract C2, and the reason it is a
    boundary rather than a lint is that claims are append-only: there is no
    correcting a row once it is written under a key nothing looks up.

    `category` is optional because the store is keyed on the field name alone and
    a caller reducing one field does not always have a `ComponentInstance` in
    hand. Passing it is strictly stronger and should be preferred: without it the
    check is membership in the union of all keys, which admits `chemistry` for an
    inverter. The other enforcement point (`ComponentInstance.fields`) always has

"""H.4 - the statement sequence, asserted without a database.

Decision 9's measured finding is that an advisory lock taken *inside* a trigger
does not work: the statement snapshot a trigger's queries run against is taken
before the trigger body acquires the lock, so a concurrent waiter still reads a
stale chain tip. Eight concurrent writers produced 42 silent forks under that
design. `sql/07_audit_event.sql` says in as many words that the fix cannot be
expressed as a constraint or a trigger, and is "enforced by code review and by
the Python client library, NOT by this schema".

That makes the shape of the caller sequence a property of *this* package and of
nothing else - so it is tested here, against a recording stand-in, and the
property holds in any environment. `tests/test_audit_concurrency.py` proves the
lock actually prevents forks, which needs a live server; this file proves the
lock is issued, in the right place, as its own statement, which does not.

The distinction matters because the two failures look nothing alike. A lock
folded into the INSERT would pass a load test on a fast machine and fail on a
slow one; a missing lock fails only under contention. Neither is visible in a
diff. Statement order is.

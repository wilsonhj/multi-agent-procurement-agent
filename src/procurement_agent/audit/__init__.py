"""WP-H - the audit envelope, contract C4.

`audit.event` is the append-only, hash-chained record of every extraction,
conflict detection and resolution the pipeline performs (NFR-02, plan Decision
9). The table shipped first; this is the library that computes what goes in it.
**Nothing may emit an event until this exists** - not because the bytes were
unknown, but because nothing could compute them.

The four pieces, each owning one of D-13's answers:

* `canonical` (H.2) - RFC 8785 canonicalisation, in Python and not in SQL.
* `envelope` (H.3) - the preimage, the SHA-256 digest, and the v1 taxonomy.
* `writer` (H.4) - the advisory lock, as its own statement before the INSERT.
* `verify` (H.5) - the chain walk and its CLI.

**Why C4 uses JCS while C6 uses sorted-key JSON with `repr` floats.** D-13 asks
for this boundary to be restated in WP-H rather than in the decision record, and
`envelope` carries the long version. In short: an audit chain must be verifiable
by an implementation that is not this one, so cross-language agreement outranks
Python fidelity, and ECMAScript number rules collapsing `650.0` to `650` is a
price C4 pays. The workbook projection cannot pay it, because that int/float
distinction is data the store genuinely carries.

**Deferred, and named here so the boundary is not read as permanent.** D-13 also
assigns WP-H a separately chained `audit.run_event` table for run-scoped events
- gap-triggered web searches (A-49) and the `--accept-incomplete` compose-gate
override - and the taxonomy amendment removing the `web_search` value that
`audit.event` structurally cannot store. Both need `sql/` changes, and both land
with WP-H's first emitter. Two further `sql/` changes D-13 requires are also
outstanding: dropping `recorded_at`'s `DEFAULT clock_timestamp()`, which section
4 replaces with a caller-supplied value, and updating `sql/README.md` decisions
5-7. Nothing here depends on the DEFAULT, and `writer` always supplies the
column.

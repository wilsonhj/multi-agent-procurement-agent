"""H.4 - the caller sequence, with the advisory lock as its own statement.

`sql/07_audit_event.sql` states the measured finding this module exists to
implement, and states why it cannot live in the schema: an advisory lock taken
inside a trigger does not work, because the statement snapshot a trigger's
queries run against is taken *before* the trigger body acquires the lock, so a
concurrent waiter still reads a stale chain tip. Eight concurrent writers
produced 42 silent forks under that design. There is no way to express "take
this lock first" as a constraint or a trigger without reintroducing the bug, so
the discipline is "enforced by code review and by the Python client library, NOT
by this schema". This is that library.

    1. SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(stream)::bigint);  -- own statement
    2. SELECT hash FROM audit.event WHERE stream = $1 ORDER BY seq DESC LIMIT 1;
    3. build the envelope and the digest, in Python (H.2, H.3)
    4. INSERT INTO audit.event (...) VALUES (...);              -- same txn

**Step 1 is separate for a reason that survives refactoring.** Folding it into
step 4 as a CTE or a scalar subquery puts the lock and the read of the tip in
one statement, which gets one snapshot - the same bug in different clothes. The
statement order is asserted in `tests/test_audit_writer.py` without a server,
and its consequence is measured in `tests/test_audit_live.py` with one.

**No commit here.** `sql/07` requires the audit row to land in the same
transaction as the business write it describes: "Rollback erasing the audit
record is correct, not a bug: if the extraction rolled back, it did not happen".
So the caller owns the transaction, and this module only ever adds to it.

**This also means a future parallel caller must call `append_event` itself, once
per worker transaction - never through a shared observer.** Nothing here assumes
a single caller; a hook or callback shared across worker processes would not see
what a sibling process just committed, the same race one layer up. See
`docs/architecture.md`'s "Persistence and execution" section for the argument and
an external example of the failure mode.

**No psycopg import.** The connection is a structural `Protocol`. `psycopg` sits
behind the `store` extra for NFR-04, and C4's envelope is not swappable
infrastructure - it should be importable, and testable, without a driver
present.

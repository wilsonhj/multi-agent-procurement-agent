"""An in-memory `RerankerPort` scoring by query-term overlap.

Term overlap is the thing a reranker is supposed to improve on, so this reference
declares `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY` absent and its contract `xfail(strict=True)`s. It
is the honest position: a cross-encoder ranks a paraphrase above a decoy that
shares more words, and nothing here can.

What it does hold is the structural half, which is where a real reranker is most
likely to go wrong: it returns only chunks it was given, it respects the limit,
and the source tier survives - the stage most likely to rebuild its result
objects is the one FR-RAG-03 most needs to keep them intact through.

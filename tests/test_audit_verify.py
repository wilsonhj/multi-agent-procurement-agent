"""H.5 - what the chain verifier detects, and what it provably cannot.

Every test here runs against rows held in memory rather than against a server.
That is not a convenience: verification is a pure function of the stored
columns, and keeping it one means the guarantee - *an edit that is not re-sealed
is detected* - is checkable everywhere, including in an environment with no
database at all. Decision 9's broader wording, "a superuser can edit a row but
cannot make the chain re-verify", is not what these tests assert, because it is
not true; `verify`'s module docstring carries the correction.

The "what a chain walk provably cannot detect" section is the honest half. A
truncated tail is undetectable, and so is any re-sealed suffix - truncation is
just the case where the rewritten suffix is empty. Both are asserted rather than
argued, because a limitation that only exists in a comment is one nobody knows
they are relying on, and because a test that merely asserted a caveat *existed*
would stay green long after the caveat became false.

The other half of the honesty is `payload_not_canonical`. D-13 hashes the parsed
payload object, so the stored bytes of `payload_canonical` are not covered by
the digest and five distinct stored strings share one. That check is the only
thing pinning them, D-13 does not require it, and
`PAYLOAD_FORGERIES_THE_DIGEST_CANNOT_SEE` exists so that deleting it cannot be a
quiet change.

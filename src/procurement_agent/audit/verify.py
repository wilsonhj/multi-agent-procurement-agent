"""H.5 - chain verification, and the CLI that runs it.

Decision 9 leans on this chain as "the only mechanism that survives the
superuser bypass - a superuser can edit a row but cannot make the chain
re-verify". **That claim is too broad, and this module does not make it.** What
is actually guaranteed is narrower:

    An edit that is not re-sealed is detected. Every field D-13 section 2 puts
    inside the preimage is recomputed from the stored columns, so changing any
    of them - or the links between rows - and leaving the digests alone produces
    a report that names the row.

That is worth having, and it is not tamper-proofing. The digest is unkeyed and
the algorithm is public, so anyone who can edit a row can also recompute its
digest; and because **nothing outside the chain pins the tip**, recomputing
forward from the edited row to the end is always available. See "what it cannot
detect" below.

**Verification is a pure function of the rows** (`verify_events`), with the
database reduced to a `SELECT`. That keeps every property testable without a
server, and it means the CLI is a transport rather than a place where checks can
hide. `verify_events` never raises: a row it cannot hash becomes a defect, since
unwinding the walk would discard the findings already made on every other row -
and on every stream after this one.

**What it cannot detect, stated plainly.** Any *suffix rewritten in place and
re-sealed*. Edit the rows, recompute their digests forward, and the chain is
internally perfect again. A truncated tail is the special case where the
rewritten suffix is empty, and it is not the cheapest one: re-attributing the
last event costs one row edited and one digest recomputed - no re-chaining, no
DELETE, no TRUNCATE. So the GRANT in `sql/07` (no DELETE, no TRUNCATE, to any
role) and the tripwire triggers, which do cover truncation, do not cover this.

The event this most matters for is the last `resolution` of every stream, which
D-13 calls "the highest-repudiation-risk record in the system: the name of the
human who shipped a workbook past unresolved conflicts" - and which is by
construction at the tip, where the rewrite is cheapest.

This is inherent to an unkeyed hash chain with no external witness, so it is a
limit of the design and not a defect in `verify_events`; the tests assert it
rather than argue it. Decision 9's position stands as the mitigation -
privilege separation is the boundary and the chain is tamper-*evidence* layered
on top - and the durable answer is shipping this log to a write-once sink or
otherwise witnessing the tip, which `sql/07` also says and which is not
attempted here. That remedy covers the whole family, not truncation alone.

⚠️ `sql/07_audit_event.sql` still carries the unqualified "cannot make the chain
re-verify" wording; it needs the same correction, and this module is not the
owner of that file.

**Confidentiality.** `sql/07`'s RLS policy hides restricted documents from
`procurement_app`, so a verification run must connect as an identity entitled to
see them and set `app.allow_restricted` - "exactly as the confidentiality model
intends, and a chain walk that skipped rows would fail to verify rather than
pass quietly". The CLI sets it; a run that could not would report broken links
on every restricted stream.

    `_check_digest` for why that is an integrity property and not a nicety.

    **The canonicality check is required for the integrity claim, not an extra.**

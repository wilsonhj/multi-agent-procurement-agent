"""H.3 - the audit envelope, the preimage, and the digest D-13 section 2 froze.

**The golden digests below were derived from the decision record and `rfc8785`,
not from the code they test.** A hash test whose expected value came out of the
implementation asserts only that the implementation is deterministic, which is
the one property a wrong preimage also has. Each constant here was computed by
canonicalising D-13 section 2's object literal directly and taking SHA-256 of
the result; the implementation had not been written when they were produced.

**The trap this file exists for** is `test_a_payload_embeds_as_an_object...`.
D-13 warns that `payload` embeds as the *parsed JSON object* and not as the
`payload_canonical` string, that both readings look obvious, and that they hash
differently. So `WRONG_STRING_EMBEDDED_DIGEST` is recorded here too: the test
does not merely check the right answer, it names the wrong one and refuses it.
Without that, the failure mode is a chain that verifies under this repo's
implementation and under no other - which D-13 calls its own worst case.

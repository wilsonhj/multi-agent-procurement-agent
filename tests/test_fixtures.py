"""The committed fixture sets, and the assertions that stop them rotting (T0.6).

`tasks.md` specifies the decoupling technique these exist for: "Each team builds
against **committed fixture files** matching the frozen schemas. WP-B ships golden
claim JSON; WP-E consumes it and ships golden conflict JSON; WP-F and WP-G consume
that. Nobody waits on anybody's service."

That only works if the fixtures are *known* to still match the schemas, so every
file here is checked three ways, and the rationale lives here rather than being
repeated on each test:

1. **It validates** against its model — catches a schema change the fixture was
   never updated for.
2. **Its canonical bytes are unchanged.** Not a structural compare: an earlier
   version of this module asserted `model_dump() == json.loads(file)`, which is
   blind to serialisation drift. Regenerating with `json.dumps`' default
   `ensure_ascii=True` rewrites the Sungrow fixture's `°` to `\\u00b0` — different
   bytes, identical structure, and the structural check passed. Comparing bytes
   subsumes the structural check and closes that hole.
3. **It still means what it was written to mean.** Schema-valid, byte-canonical
   JSON encoding the wrong worked example is the failure neither check above sees.

Only frozen contracts get fixtures. C2/C3 (claims), C5 (conflicts) and **C6 (the
workbook projection)** are covered. C6 was deliberately absent while its format
was unfrozen - publishing a golden projection then would have frozen by accident
the one decision `tasks.md` says must be made deliberately - and it ships now
that D-14 is adopted and T0.5 is closed.

The C6 fixture is the one kind whose *behavioural* assertions live elsewhere, in
`test_workbook_projection.py`: the check that earns its place is regenerating the
artifact from the synthetic store it was built from, and that store is code, not
JSON. What is checked here is the same three ways as everything else - the loader
below revalidates the shape and recomputes the vintage stamp from the payload
alone, which is a real check and not a pass-through.

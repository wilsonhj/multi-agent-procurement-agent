-- public.chunk -- contract C1.
--
-- The retrieval unit produced by WP-C indexing (FR-RAG-01/02/05, plan.md
-- Decisions 3a/3b/5/6).
--
-- Depends on: 01_extensions_and_settings.sql (vector, pg_trgm), 02_document.sql.

-- `tsv` is generated with the TWO-argument to_tsvector(regconfig, text), which
-- PostgreSQL's own catalog marks IMMUTABLE (pg_proc.provolatile = 'i'), so it is
-- legal directly inside GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED. Verified against a live
-- PostgreSQL 17.10: the two-argument form creates the table, and the ONE-argument
-- to_tsvector(text) is the STABLE one that fails with "generation expression is
-- not immutable" -- because it reads default_text_search_config at runtime.
--
-- Pinning the configuration in the call is therefore the whole fix; no IMMUTABLE
-- wrapper function is needed. An earlier draft of this file added one, on the
-- mistaken belief that the two-argument form was STABLE. Worth naming, because
-- wrapping a genuinely STABLE function and declaring the wrapper IMMUTABLE is
-- not a harmless workaround -- it lies to the planner and can silently corrupt
-- any index built on it. The same immutability is why the standard
-- `CREATE INDEX ... USING gin(to_tsvector('english', col))` idiom works at all.

-- per command, so INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE each need their own permissive policy or
-- the SELECT-only policy above would leave them at zero rows despite the GRANT
-- below allowing them.
--
-- **The UPDATE and DELETE policies carry the confidentiality predicate.** The
-- first version used `USING (true)` on both, on the reasoning that RLS is for
-- retrieval-time visibility and the write path should sit exactly where the
-- GRANT puts it. Review showed what that costs: a permissive `USING (true)` is
-- OR'd with the SELECT policy, a WHERE-less UPDATE needs no SELECT, and
-- `access_restricted` was inside the app's own UPDATE column set. So
--
--     UPDATE public.chunk SET access_restricted = false;
--
-- ran as procurement_app, returned `UPDATE 2`, and declassified a row that role
-- could not read one statement earlier. `DELETE FROM public.chunk` likewise
-- destroyed a row it could not see. Decision 3c's basis is "RLS never leaked a
-- row in any test" -- the application role, which is the principal the control
-- exists to contain, defeated it in one statement.
--
-- With the predicate in `USING`, a restricted row is not a candidate for UPDATE
-- or DELETE unless the session has set `app.allow_restricted` -- i.e. unless it
-- is already entitled to see the row. Correcting a misclassification stays
-- possible for an entitled session, which is the case the narrow column grant
-- was written for; it just is no longer possible blind.

-- procurement_app cannot switch its own confidentiality off. Every policy above
-- admits `current_setting('app.allow_restricted', true) = 'true'`, and the
-- application role sets that GUC itself -- including from the connection string,
-- before any statement is issued. Permissive policies are OR'd, so no addition
-- to the set above can narrow it; `AS RESTRICTIVE` is AND'd, which is why this
-- is a new policy rather than an edit. The full argument, the measured attack
-- matrix, and why `WITH CHECK (true)` is spelled out rather than defaulted are
-- on the equivalent policy in 02_document.sql -- read that one first.
--
-- This table's predicate is its own `access_restricted` column rather than a
-- derivation helper, matching chunk_confidentiality_select above: a chunk may be
-- *more* restricted than its parent, so the flag is stored here, maintained by
-- the inheritance trigger at the foot of this file.
--
-- The trigger and this policy compose in the safe direction. The trigger raises
-- `access_restricted` on the NEW row before the check runs, and `WITH CHECK
-- (true)` accepts the raised value, so procurement_app indexing a restricted
-- document still writes the chunk -- and then cannot read it back. Reverse the
-- `WITH CHECK` to the defaulted `USING` and that insert fails instead, which is
-- again the safe action becoming the failing one.

-- audit.event -- contract C4. The append-only, hash-chained audit envelope
-- (plan.md Decision 9; tasks.md WP-H).
--
-- Every extraction, conflict detection and resolution this pipeline performs is
-- expected to also write one of these rows, in the SAME transaction as the
-- business write. Rollback erasing the audit record is correct, not a bug: if
-- the extraction rolled back, it did not happen, and logging that it did would
-- be a false record. The genuine "we attempted X and it failed" case is a
-- different event class (event_type = attempt_failed below), logged from the
-- exception handler in a NEW transaction after the failure. Do not reach for
-- dblink or any other autonomous-transaction trick to make an audit row survive
-- the rollback of its own business transaction -- plan.md Decision 9 explicitly
-- rejects this, because it reintroduces exactly the failure (a logged event
-- that did not really happen) the same-transaction rule exists to prevent.
--
-- THE ADVISORY LOCK IS NOT IN THIS FILE, and that is deliberate. Decision 9's
-- measured finding: an advisory lock taken inside a trigger on this table does
-- not work, because the statement snapshot a trigger's queries run against is
-- taken before the trigger body acquires the lock -- a concurrent waiter still
-- reads a stale chain tip, and 8 concurrent writers produced 42 silent forks
-- under exactly this design. The fix that measured zero forks is a lock taken
-- as ITS OWN STATEMENT by the Python caller, before it reads the chain tip and
-- before it INSERTs. There is no way to express "take this lock first" as a
-- table constraint or a trigger without reintroducing the bug being fixed, so
-- it is not attempted here. The expected caller sequence (WP-H H.4), enforced
-- by code review and by the Python client library, NOT by this schema:
--
--   1. SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(stream)::bigint);  -- own statement
--   2. SELECT hash FROM audit.event
--        WHERE stream = $1 ORDER BY seq DESC LIMIT 1;           -- read the tip
--   3. -- in Python, per WP-H H.2 and clarifications.md D-13 (ADOPTED
--      -- 2026-08-07), which settles the bytes this file previously left as
--      -- "...". Canonicalise with RFC 8785, NOT jsonb -- jsonb normalises key
--      -- order but preserves whatever numeric literal text it was given, so
--      -- 1.0 and 1.00 stay textually distinct.
--      --
--      -- The preimage is ONE JCS OBJECT, never a concatenation. An earlier
--      -- version of this comment sketched
--      --     hash := sha256(prev_hash || canonical_payload || ...)
--      -- and that is wrong twice: the trailing "..." left the field set
--      -- unenumerated, so two implementations could disagree about what is
--      -- covered while both believing they followed this comment; and a
--      -- delimiter-free concatenation is ambiguous by construction, since
--      -- distinct field values can produce identical bytes. D-13 §2:
--      --
--      --     hash = SHA-256(JCS({
--      --         "v": 1, "stream", "seq", "event_type", "actor",
--      --         "recorded_at", "prev_hash": lowercase-hex or null,
--      --         "payload": {...}
--      --     }))
--      --
--      -- The object's keys ARE the enumeration, and JCS gives unambiguous
--      -- framing for free. Two details that change the hash and are easy to
--      -- read the other way: `payload` embeds as the PARSED JSON OBJECT, not
--      -- as the payload_canonical string; and `recorded_at` is supplied by
--      -- the caller as RFC 3339 UTC with the Z offset and fixed microsecond
--      -- precision, NOT defaulted -- a hashed timestamp is tamper-evident,
--      -- a defaulted one cannot be pre-computed by the caller.
--      --
--      -- "v": 1 is inside the preimage and is load-bearing. Without it,
--      -- changing the hashed field set later invalidates every existing
--      -- chain, because a verifier can no longer recompute historical
--      -- hashes. It must exist before the first event is ever emitted.
--   4. INSERT INTO audit.event (...) VALUES (...);              -- same txn

"""The six ports' behavioural contracts — NFR-04, ADR-001 decision 2.

> **What a green run here proves, and what it does not.** Every adapter these
> contracts run against is an in-memory reference that was written to satisfy
> them. Green means the contract is **expressible and self-consistent** — some
> object can satisfy it. It is not evidence that Docling, vLLM, pgvector or any
> other real backend can, because none of them exist in this repository and none
> has ever been run against this file. NFR-04 asks that the six swap points be
> *swappable*; nothing has yet been swapped. The executable form of this
> paragraph is `test_every_registered_adapter_is_an_in_memory_reference` in
> `test_conformance_matrix.py`, which goes red the day the sentence stops being
> true.

**Why the tests exist before the adapters.** `docs/development.md` records that
the first adapter "decides the layout for everyone after it"; ADR-001 answers it
by landing the contract suite first, so that the first real adapter arrives to a
contract instead of defining one. Every assertion below is therefore written
against the Protocol, never against a reference's internals.

**How a capability gates a test** — `cases(port, capability)`:

* declared → the test runs and must pass;
* declared absent, of either kind → **`xfail(strict=True)`**, carrying the kind
  and the reason;
* neither declared nor explained → the test runs unmarked and fails on its own
  merits, and `test_every_adapter_accounts_for_every_capability_of_its_port`
  names the omission precisely.

**Why an absence is never a `skip`, which was the first design and is wrong.**
`skip` does not execute the contract, so a `NOT_APPLICABLE` declaration with a
plausible reason attached removes a test from the suite and nothing ever looks at
it again — which is the "silently absent" state ADR-001 adopted this pattern to
prevent, spelled with a reason string. A strict `xfail` executes the body and
demands it fail, so an adapter that has quietly *grown* the capability goes red
and gets its declaration corrected. What that still cannot catch is a
misclassified kind — an `UNIMPLEMENTED` gap dressed as `NOT_APPLICABLE` — because
inapplicability is not falsifiable from outside. The kind is therefore a claim to
a reader (permanent property versus work item) that the matrix records and
`AbsenceKind` names; what the suite *enforces* is that the contract genuinely
fails, whichever kind is claimed.

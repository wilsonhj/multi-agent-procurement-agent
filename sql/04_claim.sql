-- the extracted content of the document named by `document_id` -- the price, the
-- warranty term, the certification status -- so a claim row is exactly as

--
-- sql/README.md's decision 10 previously argued RLS here would be "inventing

-- table of references; it is a table of extracted values, and AC-8 says content

-- RLS's default-deny is per command, so INSERT needs its own policy or the
-- GRANT below is starved. WITH CHECK (true): what a role may write is the
-- GRANT's business, exactly as on document/chunk. Note that this leaves
-- `INSERT ... RETURNING claim_id` failing for a restricted document under
-- procurement_app -- RLS applies the SELECT policy to the returned row -- and
-- claim_id is GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, so conflict_candidate needs that
-- RETURNING. Writing claims about a confidential document is pipeline work and

-- procurement_app cannot switch its own confidentiality off. See the equivalent
-- policy in 02_document.sql for the measured attack matrix, why this is a new
-- RESTRICTIVE policy rather than an edit to the permissive ones (they are OR'd;
-- this one is AND'd), and why `WITH CHECK (true)` is spelled out.
--
-- The predicate is public.document_is_restricted(document_id), derived rather
-- than stored, exactly as claim_confidentiality_select above expresses it -- a
-- claim is as confidential as the document it was extracted from, and this table
-- carries no flag of its own.
--
-- Note what this also closes, which the GUC escape alone did not explain.
-- `claim_ingest_select` is permissive and `USING (true)`, and RLS role matching
-- follows *inherited* membership: a mis-granted `GRANT procurement_ingest TO
-- procurement_app` therefore applies that policy to the application role with no
-- `SET ROLE` issued at all. Measured. Being AND'd, the policy below still denies
-- the row in that state -- so a membership mis-grant degrades from fail-open to
-- fail-closed. 00_roles.sql revokes the membership on every apply and
-- tests/test_sql_behaviour.py asserts it is absent; this is the layer that holds
-- if both of those are somehow bypassed.

-- **These two exist so the append-only trigger keeps speaking.** The obvious
-- move on an append-only table is to declare no UPDATE/DELETE policy at all, so
-- a future mis-grant of those verbs finds zero eligible rows. Measured, that is
-- worse, because RLS filters rows out *before* a FOR EACH ROW trigger sees them:
--
--     SET ROLE procurement_owner;
--     UPDATE public.claim SET confidence = 0.1;   -- UPDATE 0     <- silent
--     DELETE FROM public.claim;                   -- DELETE 0     <- silent
--
-- The data survived, but the statement reported success, and plan.md Decision 9
-- picks the trigger tripwire precisely because it is *loud*: "a fork is loud,
-- not silent" is the same argument one table over. This is the empty-table trap
-- from sql/README.md in a new costume -- a FOR EACH ROW trigger cannot fire on
-- rows RLS has already removed, so a checklist run against an RLS-filtered table
-- proves exactly as little as one run against an empty one.
--
-- With `USING (true)` the rows stay eligible, the trigger fires, and the same
-- attempt raises. Nothing is loosened: no role is granted UPDATE or DELETE on
-- this table (see the GRANTs below), so these policies are reachable only in the
-- mis-grant case they exist to make audible.

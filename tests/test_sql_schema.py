"""Structural assertions over the DDL in `sql/`.

**What this is and is not.** These are text-level checks over the migration
files. They cannot prove PostgreSQL behaves as the DDL intends - only a live
server can, and the live run that was actually performed is recorded in
sql/README.md's "Live verification actually performed" table, with the exact
commands and results.

What they *can* do is stop a fix silently regressing. Every property below
corresponds to a defect that was measured against a running cluster and then
closed; without a test, closing it is a comment in a file nobody re-runs. So each
test names the attack it descends from, and the assertion is chosen to fail if
that specific line is reverted rather than merely if the file is reformatted.

**That premise has changed.** This docstring used to end "the repo has no
live-database fixture and no driver dependency, and adding one would change the
CI story for the whole project" — which was true, and was the reason to accept
structural checks alone. The CI story has since been changed deliberately:
`tests/test_sql_behaviour.py` runs the attacks against a real server, and the
`sql` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` supplies one from a pgvector service
container.

So the division of labour is now explicit rather than a concession:

- **here** — text-level, no server, runs in every developer's default `pytest`.
  Catches a fix being deleted or edited.
- **`test_sql_behaviour.py`** — runs the attack. Catches a fix that was never
  right, which is the failure mode this schema actually had: `USING (true)` on a
  write policy reads as "the write path is unrestricted", not as "the
  application role can declassify every confidential row in one statement".

Both are worth keeping. The structural checks stay green without Postgres, so
they still run for a contributor who has not started one; and they fail on a
reverted line even where two independent mechanisms would keep the *behaviour*
correct, which is a real gap the behavioural suite hit and had to be widened for.

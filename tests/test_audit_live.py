"""H.4 and H.5 against a running PostgreSQL - including the merge-blocking load test.

`sql/README.md` names concurrency as the one property its behaviour suite leaves
unproven: Decision 9's measured failure - 8 concurrent writers producing 42
silent forks - "is a property of the *caller's* advisory-lock discipline, not of
this DDL, and nothing here exercises it". This file is what exercises it.

**The control is the point.** `test_a_without_the_lock_...` runs byte-identical
code with `lock_stream` omitted and asserts that it *does* fork. Without that,
`test_a_eight_concurrent_writers_produce_no_forks` proves nothing: a load test
that never actually races passes just as green as one that races and is
protected, and this repo has been burned by a skipped test read as a pass. The
two tests differ in exactly one call.

**Why the deliberate hold.** Both paths sleep between reading the chain tip and
inserting. Relying on scheduler luck to hit a microsecond-wide window makes the
control flaky, and a flaky control is worse than none - it eventually gets
deleted. Widening the window makes the race certain in both directions, which
keeps the comparison fair: the locked path holds the lock across the same sleep
and must still produce zero forks.

**Skipped unless `PROCUREMENT_TEST_DSN` points at a disposable database**, on
the same terms as `tests/test_sql_behaviour.py` - see that file's docstring for
how to raise one locally, and note its warning that a Unix socket with `trust`
cannot reproduce a CI authentication failure. The database is dropped and
recreated. Never point this at anything you care about.

A skip here is not a pass. If this file skipped, the advisory lock is unproven
and H.4 is not done, whatever the rest of the suite says.

"""An in-memory `VectorStorePort`: a dict, scanned exhaustively.

**Exhaustive by construction, which is the interesting part.** plan Decision 3a
chose exact search over an ANN index because pgvector was measured *silently*
under-returning on a filtered top-k. A dict scan cannot reproduce that defect, so
this reference declares `EXHAUSTIVE_RECALL` and passes its contract - and the
value of that is not the passing test but the row it puts in the matrix. An
approximate-index adapter arriving later has to declare the capability absent and
write down why, in front of a reviewer, before it ships.

The filters are applied *before* scoring rather than to the result. That is
`architecture.md` invariant 8 - access control is enforced during retrieval - and
it is why `search` takes `allowed_document_ids` as a parameter instead of the
caller filtering afterwards.

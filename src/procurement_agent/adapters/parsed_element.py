"""What the adapter side has to supply about `ports.ParsedElement`.

`ParsedElement` is the unit both `ParserPort` and `OCRPort` return. Track 0
amends the Protocol with optional `bbox`, `table`, `page_quality` and `role`
(D-23 / P2-C1), so a consumer may rely on those members. `TextElement` is the
concrete shape the in-memory references return and must stay a structural match.

`kind` is typed `str` and documented as "heading, body, table or figure". A
Protocol cannot express a closed vocabulary over a `str`, so an adapter emitting
`"paragraph"` or `"Table"` is correct under the type and unusable to every
consumer that switches on the value. `_assert_element_shape` in the contract
suite is what holds adapters to it meanwhile.

    `ParsedElement` declares plain annotated attributes, which a type checker
    reads as read-write, so a frozen implementation is not guaranteed to satisfy
    it. `docs/architecture.md` asks for "frozen models for immutable evidence",
    and a parsed element is evidence; the Protocol as written cannot promise that
    an immutable one is admissible. Declaring the members `ReadOnly`, or as
    properties, would be the fix, and it belongs in `ports/`.

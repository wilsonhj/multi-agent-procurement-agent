"""FR-HITL-06's two invariants, over every route that reaches a `CanonicalField`.

`tests/test_schema_invariants.py` covers the constructor and plain assignment.
This file covers the routes that skip validation entirely, and the one a
validator structurally cannot see.

The invariants:

  1. `conflict_status is RESOLVED` implies `resolution is not None` - a decision
     with no record of who made it. **Since D-18 this is structural**: RESOLVED
     is derived from `resolution` being present and is not stored, so no route -
     validated, unvalidated, or a raw `__dict__` write - can produce the
     forbidden state. The tests below assert exactly that, on every route that
     used to need its own override: `model_construct`, pickle, `copy.copy`,
     `copy.deepcopy`, `model_copy(deep=True)` and `__dict__` itself.
  2. A recorded `Resolution` is never replaced or cleared. Every validator passes
     a swap, because the resulting state is perfectly legal; only a check that
     can see the *transition* catches it. FR-HITL-06: "logged immutably". This
     one is still a guard, in `__setattr__` and `evolve`.

-- unscoped policy (default: PUBLIC) applies the same rule uniformly rather
-- than leaving the owner role staring at zero rows with no applicable policy
-- during a maintenance query. Only an actual PostgreSQL superuser bypasses

-- for a large, dynamic, per-request ID set (it would need a session GUC
-- re-issued on every call). RLS here is the boundary a caller cannot forget to
-- apply; allowed_document_ids is the boundary that scopes *which*
-- unrestricted-or-authorized documents one specific query may see. C7 (the
-- ACL/labelling model) is explicitly unfrozen per tasks.md, so this
-- deliberately implements no more than the field the frozen Pydantic schema
-- already commits to -- see sql/README.md's decisions list.

-- The ingest principal (00_roles.sql, procurement_ingest).
--
-- These policies are scoped `TO procurement_ingest` -- the one place in this

-- The rule exists so an ops session as procurement_owner does not stare at zero
-- rows; here the scoping is the entire point, because the whole difference
-- between the write principal and the retrieval principal is which rows each may
-- see. An unscoped `USING (true)` would hand procurement_app the same
-- unrestricted read and delete the control.
--
-- Why this is needed at all: RLS applies a table's `FOR SELECT` policy as a
-- WITH CHECK against the proposed row whenever an INSERT carries `RETURNING` or
-- `ON CONFLICT`, so the documented idempotent-ingest idiom eleven lines above
-- --
--     INSERT ... VALUES (..., access_restricted => true)
--     ON CONFLICT (content_hash) DO NOTHING;
--
-- -- failed with "new row violates row-level security policy" for exactly the
-- confidential documents it exists to serve, while the same statement with
-- `access_restricted => false` succeeded. Full reasoning, and the two rejected
-- alternatives (an `xmin` read-back policy, which does not work; reusing
-- `app.allow_restricted`, which leaks through a connection pool), are in
-- 00_roles.sql above the CREATE ROLE.
--
-- The UPDATE policy is `USING (true)` for this role deliberately, where
-- procurement_app's carries the confidentiality predicate. That predicate exists
-- to stop a role *declassifying a row it cannot read*; procurement_ingest can
-- read every row, so there is no blind write to prevent -- the reclassification
-- path this table's narrow column grant was written for is precisely this
-- role's job. The column grant still bounds it to the same two columns.

-- The shared confidentiality derivation, used by the RLS policies on every
-- downstream table that carries a document_id (claim, audit.event, job) and,
-- one hop further out, by conflict/resolution via 05_conflict.sql.
--
-- **Why this function exists.** RLS was originally applied only to `document`
-- and `chunk`, on the reasoning that those are the two tables on the retrieval
-- path. Review measured what the other tables then do, as procurement_app,
-- against a document that role cannot see:
--
--     SELECT document_id FROM public.document WHERE document_id = 'doc-secret';
--      (0 rows)
--     SELECT document_id, field, value, verbatim_value FROM public.claim
--       WHERE document_id = 'doc-secret';
--      doc-secret | price_per_watt_dc | 0.19 | CONFIDENTIAL 0.19 USD/W
--     SELECT payload FROM audit.event WHERE document_id = 'doc-secret';
--      {"price_per_watt_dc": 0.19}
--
-- `claim.value`/`verbatim_value`, `audit.event.payload`, `conflict.explanation`,
-- `resolution.value_before`/`value_after` and `job.payload` all carry document
-- content, not just references to it. A confidentiality control on `document`
-- and `chunk` alone does not implement NFR-03 or AC-8; it implements them on two
-- of the seven tables that hold the material.
--
-- **Derived, not denormalised.** `chunk` carries its own `access_restricted`
-- column filled by a BEFORE trigger, because a chunk may be *more* restricted
-- than its parent (a confidential paragraph in an open datasheet) and so needs
-- somewhere to record that. No such case exists for claim/audit.event/job: their
-- restriction is exactly their document's. Deriving it on read rather than
-- copying it therefore removes a whole class of bug rather than adding one --
-- reclassifying a document takes effect immediately on every dependent table,
-- with no backfill to forget and no column that can drift out of step.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER with `SET app.allow_restricted`, for the reason spelled out
-- at length on chunk_inherit_access_restricted() in 03_chunk.sql: `document` is
-- FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, which applies to procurement_owner too, so
-- ownership alone would make this lookup return zero rows and every dependent
-- policy fail closed on every restricted document. The setting is scoped to the
-- function invocation and reverts on exit, so it cannot leak to the caller. The
-- body reads one boolean from one table by primary key, takes no caller-supplied
-- SQL, and returns nothing else.
--
-- STABLE, not IMMUTABLE: the answer changes when a document is reclassified.
-- STABLE is what lets the planner call it once per document_id within a
-- statement instead of once per row.

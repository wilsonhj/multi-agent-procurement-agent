"""Swap points required by NFR-04.

    "Parsers, OCR, embedders, vector store, reranker, and LLM must be swappable
    behind stable interfaces."

Six interfaces, one per named swap point. They are structural Protocols rather
than base classes so that adapters can wrap third-party clients without
inheriting from anything here, and so no concrete dependency leaks into the core
package. No concrete adapter exists yet; when one does it will depend on an
optional extra declared in pyproject.toml, never on the core - the extras
there currently declare dependency groups only.

**These Protocols are synchronous, deliberately.** Concurrency in this system is
per-process, not per-coroutine: the runner is a Postgres job table with a
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` worker loop (plan.md Decision 1), so scaling
means more worker processes. Parse and OCR are CPU-bound in-process; embedding
and reranking already take batches, so their parallelism is inside the payload
rather than at the call boundary; and the vector store is a local Postgres
round-trip under Decision 3a. A caller that needs overlap can wrap any of these
in a ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor without touching the interface,
and an async variant can be added alongside later - Protocols are structural, so
that is additive rather than a breaking change.

The reference memo's parser-router finding applies directly: no single engine
wins across document types, so ParserPort is expected to have several
implementations selected by content signature (FR-ING-01), not one.

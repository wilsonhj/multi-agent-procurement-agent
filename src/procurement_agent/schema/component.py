        was wrong in a way that mattered.

        `CanonicalField.value` is typed `object | None`, so it is the polymorphic
        slot `schema/encoding.py` exists for. Pydantic's JSON mode collapses that
        slot: `Decimal("22.00")` and the string `"22.00"` dump to the same text,
        so two instances differing only in which one they store **tie here** -
        while `services/output/projection.py` routes the same values through
        `encode_value` and renders them differently (`{"$decimal": "22.00"}`
        against `"22.00"`). A tie between rows that are not identical hands their
        relative order back to `sorted`'s stability, which is arrival order: the
        A-6 class in its mirror form, where two artifacts differing in content
        have a byte position that is not a function of content.

        The original reason for the workaround was real - `encode_value` could
        not encode a `CanonicalField`, because `model_dump()` flattened nested
        models to plain dicts and the closed world had no `dict` rule. That was
        fixed in this same change, and this call site was not revisited with it.

        `sort_keys` is belt and braces: `encode_value` already sorts a map's
        pairs by canonical text, which is what makes this a function of content
        rather than of insertion order. The contract has three dict-valued
        parameters, and a dict iterates in insertion order, so two extractions
        that read one cooling table's rows in different orders hold equal values
        that would otherwise render differently - `services.claims._render`
        records the same hazard on the claim-identity side.

        Deliberately reads `fields` and nothing else. The raw `supplier` and
        `model` are excluded because D-4 stage 1 exists to make `Trina Solar` and
        `Trina Solar Co.,Ltd` sort together, and a tie-break that read them would
        undo the entity split silently - the obvious way to make a key unique is
        the one that breaks the thing the key was normalised for.

        AC-7 requires byte-identical output from an unchanged store, which needs a
        total order over component instances. `sorted-key JSON` orders keys *within*
        an object; it says nothing about row order *across* instances.

        `surrogate_id` is the tie-break rather than the primary key because
        (category, supplier, model) is provably not unique on real data - two Adani
        entities publish `ASB-M10-144-550` with genuinely different specs (PTC 509.9
        vs 518.2). Without the tie-break the sort is unstable exactly where the data
        is most ambiguous.

        **`surrogate_id` alone was not a tie-break, and the sentence above says
        why.** It falls back to `""`, which is the value on *both* sides whenever
        nothing has run the matcher yet - the state a freshly ingested store is
        in. `sorted` is stable, so a complete tie does not reorder: it leaks
        arrival order, and the workbook differs run to run with no value having
        changed. The cited Adani pair is exactly such a tie, because PTC lives in
        `fields` and the key did not read `fields`. **The tie-break did not cover
        the scenario it was written for**, and the test covering it happened to
        give both sides a surrogate.

        So `_stored_values()` joined the key, and the order became total *up to
        equality* over everything the key read.

        **That was not the same as total over the row it orders, and the
        difference was a live A-6 defect.** `services/output/projection.py`'s
        `_component_row` emits the raw `supplier` and `model` that the paragraph
        below deliberately keeps out of the sort, so two spellings folded onto
        one `manufacturer_key` tied on all six elements and rendered different
        rows - and `sorted`'s stability handed their byte order to arrival order.
        The cited Adani pair is exactly such a tie whenever the matcher has not
        run, which is the state a freshly ingested store is in. The claim that
        stood here - that two tying instances "produce identical rows" - was
        false for the case this docstring is written around.

        The raw strings are therefore the last two elements. The order is now
        total up to equality *over the emitted row*: two instances that still tie
        agree on every field `_component_row` writes, so their relative order
        cannot be observed in the output at all. That is the strongest guarantee
        available and the only one AC-7 needs.

        D-4 stage 5 sorts on the *normalised* keys, not the raw strings: sorting on
        `supplier` puts `Trina Solar` and `Trina Solar Co.,Ltd` far apart, so the
        entity split stage 1 exists to close reopens in the row order. The raw
        strings remain the fallback for an instance nobody has run the matcher over
        - a partially-normalised store must still have a total order, and falling
        back is visible where raising would only move the failure.

        **This key is in-memory only; it can order rows and can never itself be
        projected or hashed.** An absent nameplate becomes `float("-inf")`, which
        is totally ordered and which `encode_value` refuses - no injective
        encoding of a non-finite float exists. Anything wanting canonical bytes
        for a row must build them from the instance rather than from this tuple.

        The paragraph above is right that *sorting on* the raw supplier would

        claim false. `services/output/projection.py:_component_row` emits all
        five unfolded, so instances differing in any of them tied on every
        element of the key and still rendered different rows. `sorted` is
        stable, so the tie handed their byte order to arrival order.

        **Three of the five are lost to a fallback operator rather than to
        omission**, which is why naming only `supplier` and `model` here did not
        finish the job. Elements 2, 3 and 5 above are written `x or y`, and each
        `or` collapses an absent value into another field's:

            manufacturer_key or supplier    model_family or model
            surrogate_id or ""

        so `manufacturer_key=None` and `manufacturer_key="Adani Solar"` produce
        one key when the supplier is `"Adani Solar"`. That is reachable rather
        than contrived: `identity_keys("sungrow", ...)` returns
        `manufacturer_key == "sungrow"`, so any supplier already in normalised
        form ties - in exactly the partially-normalised store the docstring

        Rendered through `encode_value` rather than as bare tuple members

        element a function of the emitted row **by construction** rather than by
        enumeration - the same reason `_stored_values()` routes through the one
        authority instead of restating a rendering.

        Position is what makes it safe. Everything the entity split exists for
        is decided by elements 1-5, so two spellings of one manufacturer still
        sort adjacently; this element only ever separates rows that already
        agree on category, identity, nameplate, surrogate and every stored

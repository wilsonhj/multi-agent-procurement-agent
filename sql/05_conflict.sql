-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Confidentiality for the queue (NFR-03, AC-8).
--
-- `conflict.explanation` is free text written to be read by a human -- "record
-- says 0.19 USD/W, web says 0.35" -- so it carries the disputed values
-- themselves, not a reference to them. Measured as procurement_app against a
-- document that role could not see:
--
--     SELECT entry_id, explanation FROM public.conflict;
--      cf-1 | CONFIDENTIAL: record says 0.19, web says 0.35
--
-- **Why this needs its own function rather than reusing document_is_restricted.**
-- `conflict` has no document_id, and cannot: an INTER_DOCUMENT conflict is by
-- definition about two or more documents. Its confidentiality is therefore the
-- OR over the documents of its candidate claims -- restricted if ANY candidate
-- comes from a restricted document, because the explanation quotes all of them.
--
-- That derivation cannot be a stored column filled at INSERT: `conflict` rows
-- are inserted before their `conflict_candidate` rows exist (the FK runs that
-- way round), so at INSERT time there is nothing to derive from. Computing it on
-- read is what makes it correct rather than merely convenient.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER for the same reason as document_is_restricted: this walk
-- crosses `claim`, which is itself FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY as of 04_claim.sql,
-- and a lookup that cannot see restricted claims would report every conflict as
-- unrestricted -- failing open, in the one function whose job is to fail closed.
--
-- Deliberately NOT applied to `conflict_candidate` itself: that table holds only
-- (entry_id, claim_id, ordinal), no content, and a policy on it calling this
-- function -- which reads it -- is a genuine infinite recursion, which
-- PostgreSQL rejects at query time rather than at CREATE POLICY. The residual
-- exposure is that an unentitled role can see that some conflict has some number
-- of candidates; it recovers no value, unit, verbatim text or document id,
-- because claim and conflict are both gated. Recorded in sql/README.md.

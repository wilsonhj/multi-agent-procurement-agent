-- public.job -- plan.md Decision 1 / 1a, tasks.md WP-I I.1.
--
-- The stage state machine: a Postgres table, not a workflow framework.
--
-- **This table is a ledger, not a contended queue** (Decision 1a, register
-- A-45). It was designed for a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` worker fleet
-- with 15-minute leases and a sweeper; that runner was retired before anything
-- was written against it, and `orchestrator.run` is now a single-process driver
-- that maps each stage over its work with two pools and writes progress here.
--
-- The lease columns (`lease_owner`, `lease_expires_at`) and the two indexes
-- below that serve them are **deliberately retained and currently unused**, so
-- that adopting a second worker process later is a runner change rather than a
-- migration. The commented query shapes further down are what that second
-- worker would run; they are a design record, not a description of the current
-- caller. Do not read them as live.
--
-- None of this touches `05_conflict.sql`'s claim leases, which have genuine
-- multi-human contention and are unaffected.
--
-- `stage` is keyed on orchestrator.Stage
-- (src/procurement_agent/orchestrator/__init__.py) verbatim -- the same
-- discipline services/conflict_hitl/tolerance.py uses for its own table,
-- keyed on the frozen field contract rather than an invented name. Six
-- values, no more, no fewer, and deliberately no await_human_resolution stage:
-- plan.md Decision 2 detaches the human gate from the pipeline entirely, and
-- orchestrator.Stage's own docstring says so explicitly.
--
-- Depends on: 02_document.sql.

-- job is the mutable state machine itself -- unlike claim/resolution/
-- audit.event, UPDATE is granted rather than withheld, since state transitions
-- are the table's entire purpose. No DELETE: nothing in the spec ever removes a
-- job row -- a poison message is quarantined (status = 'quarantined', I.4),
-- never deleted.
--
-- **Column-level, not full-table.** The first version granted plain
-- `UPDATE ON public.job`, which is every column, and `document`/`conflict` in
-- this same file set had already established the opposite discipline for the
-- same reason. What that cost, measured as procurement_app:
--
--     UPDATE public.job SET idempotency_key = 'HIJACKED';   -- UPDATE 1
--     UPDATE public.job SET stage = 'ingest', document_id = 'doc-open',
--                          created_at = now();              -- UPDATE 1
--
-- `idempotency_key` is the whole of I.2's at-least-once guarantee: rewriting it
-- makes `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING` stop deduplicating,
-- so the retry it exists to absorb becomes a second live job racing the first --
-- and the same buggy worker that corrupts the key is the one whose retries the
-- key was protecting against. `stage`, `document_id` and `payload` define which
-- unit of work this row *is*, not how far it has got; `created_at` is the
-- worker loop's FIFO ordering key; `updated_at` is the trigger's to write, and
-- withholding it from the grant does not stop the trigger, because column
-- privileges are checked against the statement's target list and not against
-- what a BEFORE trigger assigns to NEW (verified against a live server).
--
-- What remains is exactly the state machine: status, the retry counter and its
-- backoff, the lease pair, and the error text.

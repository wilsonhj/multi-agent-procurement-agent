"""Which adapters the conformance suite runs, and what each of them claims.

**Everything in here today is a reference.** A green conformance run therefore
proves the six Protocols are *expressible* - that some object satisfies each of
them, and that the contracts are consistent enough to be satisfied at all. It is
not evidence about Docling, vLLM, pgvector or any other backend, none of which
exist in this repository. NFR-04 asks that the six swap points be swappable;
nothing has been swapped. `test_every_registered_adapter_is_an_in_memory_reference`
is that sentence in executable form, so it goes red rather than stale when the
first real adapter lands.

**Adding a real adapter.** Import it *inside* its factory, never at module scope:
this module is imported to collect the suite, and a module-scope
`import docling` would make collection fail in the lean `uv sync --extra dev`
environment CI's `checks` job uses. That single rule is what lets one registry
hold adapters whose dependencies are mutually exclusive.

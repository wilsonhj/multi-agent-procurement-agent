        The rule is the contract's own, not an invention here. Its `note`

        family would give `Condition` a different shape per category, which the
        comparison logic cannot carry - this is a known limit, not an oversight"
        - so the shape is untouched and the caller says what it is asking about.
        `CONDITION_DIMENSION_NAMES` is the unqualified question, for a caller
        that genuinely wants "do these contradict anywhere".

        No default, for the reason `ConflictQueueEntry.severity` carries none: a

        argument would reinstate it at a call site with nothing to show for it.

        **This relation is deliberately not transitive, so it must never be used to

        over the same three values yields different groups depending on the order
        they arrive - and therefore a different conflict queue from the same store.
        This is the detection predicate - `services.conflict_hitl.comparison_pairs`
        applies it to every unordered pair. Do not use it to bucket candidates;

    The gap is not cosmetic. A store could hold a row `project_store` cannot

        `model_dump()`.** `value` is typed `object | None`, so it has no schema
        to validate back against - `model_dump()` serialises whatever is in it
        and `model_validate` stores the serialised form. For a `DeclaredBand`
        that means the field silently comes back holding a `dict`:

            f.value                     # DeclaredBand
            f.evolve(confidence=0.8).value
            # {'low': 0.0, 'high': 5.0, ...}  -- no error, no warning
            f.evolve(confidence=0.8).value.resolve(650.0)
            # AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'resolve'

        That is not hypothetical: the frozen contract types `power_tolerance`
        and `bifaciality_tolerance` as `DeclaredBand`, and this module's own
        `DeclaredBand` docstring says a band is a field value like any other. It
        was also a *regression* against the `model_copy(update=...)` this method
        replaces, which shallow-copied `__dict__` and preserved the object.

        Passing live attributes keeps `value` untouched while every validator
        still runs on the result, which is the whole point of the method.
